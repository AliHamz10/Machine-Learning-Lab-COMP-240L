# HTRU2 Pulsar Stars Dataset - Feature Descriptions

## Dataset Overview
- **Source**: HTRU2 (High Time Resolution Universe Survey) - Second Data Release
- **Total Samples**: 17,898 pulsar candidates
- **Features**: 8 statistical measures
- **Target**: Binary classification (0 = Non-Pulsar, 1 = Pulsar)
- **Class Distribution**: 9.2% Pulsars, 90.8% Non-Pulsars

## Feature Descriptions

### 1. Mean of the integrated profile
- **Description**: The mean of the integrated profile (folded pulse profile)
- **Type**: Continuous
- **Range**: Typically 0.0 to 1.0 (normalized)
- **Significance**: Higher values indicate stronger pulsar signals

### 2. Standard deviation of the integrated profile
- **Description**: The standard deviation of the integrated profile
- **Type**: Continuous
- **Range**: Typically 0.0 to 1.0 (normalized)
- **Significance**: Measures the variability in the pulse profile

### 3. Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile
- **Description**: The excess kurtosis of the integrated profile
- **Type**: Continuous
- **Range**: Can be negative or positive
- **Significance**: Measures the "peakedness" of the pulse profile distribution

### 4. Skewness of the integrated profile
- **Description**: The skewness of the integrated profile
- **Type**: Continuous
- **Range**: Can be negative or positive
- **Significance**: Measures the asymmetry of the pulse profile distribution

### 5. Mean of the DM-SNR curve
- **Description**: The mean of the DM-SNR (Dispersion Measure - Signal to Noise Ratio) curve
- **Type**: Continuous
- **Range**: Typically 0.0 to 1.0 (normalized)
- **Significance**: Higher values indicate better signal quality across dispersion measures

### 6. Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve
- **Description**: The standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve
- **Type**: Continuous
- **Range**: Typically 0.0 to 1.0 (normalized)
- **Significance**: Measures the variability in signal quality across dispersion measures

### 7. Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve
- **Description**: The excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve
- **Type**: Continuous
- **Range**: Can be negative or positive
- **Significance**: Measures the "peakedness" of the DM-SNR distribution

### 8. Skewness of the DM-SNR curve
- **Description**: The skewness of the DM-SNR curve
- **Type**: Continuous
- **Range**: Can be negative or positive
- **Significance**: Measures the asymmetry of the DM-SNR distribution

## Target Variable

### target_class
- **Description**: Binary classification label
- **Values**: 0 = Non-Pulsar, 1 = Pulsar
- **Distribution**: Highly imbalanced (9.2% positive class)
- **Significance**: The main prediction target for the classification task

## Data Characteristics

### Class Imbalance
- **Non-Pulsars**: 16,259 samples (90.8%)
- **Pulsars**: 1,639 samples (9.2%)
- **Imbalance Ratio**: ~9:1

### Data Quality
- **Missing Values**: None (clean dataset)
- **Outliers**: Present in some features
- **Normalization**: Features are already normalized/scaled

## Usage Notes

1. **Class Imbalance**: Consider using stratified sampling and appropriate evaluation metrics
2. **Feature Scaling**: Features appear to be pre-normalized
3. **Statistical Significance**: Most features show significant differences between classes
4. **Model Selection**: Logistic regression works well due to linear separability
5. **Evaluation**: Use precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for comprehensive evaluation
