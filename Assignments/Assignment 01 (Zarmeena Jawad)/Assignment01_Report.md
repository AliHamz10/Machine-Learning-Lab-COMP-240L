## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive machine learning analysis for customer churn prediction in the telecommunications industry, addressing the critical business challenge of customer retention and attrition management. The study utilizes the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset, containing 7,043 customer records with 19 demographic and service-related features. Four machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest performance with 80.2% accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of automated churn prediction for business applications including customer retention, targeted marketing, and resource optimization.

## 1. Introduction

The telecommunications industry faces significant challenges in customer retention, with high customer acquisition costs and increasing competition leading to substantial revenue losses from customer churn. Traditional churn management relies on reactive approaches and manual customer analysis, which are inefficient and often too late to prevent customer loss. This study addresses these challenges by developing machine learning models that can predict customer churn based on demographic and service usage patterns.

The primary business objective is to enable telecom companies to proactively identify at-risk customers, implement targeted retention strategies, and optimize customer relationship management. This analysis supports Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) by demonstrating critical knowledge application in machine learning and data-driven decision making, while fulfilling Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) through effective use of Python libraries and comprehensive model evaluation.
