## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive machine learning analysis for wine quality prediction, addressing the business challenge of automated quality assessment in the wine industry. The study utilizes the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing 1,599 instances with 11 chemical properties. Four machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest performance with 75.3% accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of automated wine quality prediction for business applications including quality control, pricing strategies, and market segmentation.

## 1. Introduction

The wine industry faces significant challenges in maintaining consistent quality standards and implementing data-driven pricing strategies. Traditional quality assessment relies heavily on expert tasting panels, which introduces subjectivity, inconsistency, and high operational costs. This study addresses these challenges by developing machine learning models that can predict wine quality based on measurable chemical properties.

The primary business objective is to enable wineries to automate quality control processes, implement data-driven pricing strategies, and optimize market segmentation. This analysis supports Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) by demonstrating critical knowledge application in machine learning and data-driven decision making, while fulfilling Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) through effective use of Python libraries and comprehensive model evaluation.

## 2. Problem Statement and Business Context

### 2.1 Business Problem

Wine producers struggle with inconsistent quality assessment methods that lead to pricing inefficiencies and market positioning challenges. The lack of standardized, objective quality metrics results in:

- Inconsistent pricing strategies across similar quality wines
- Difficulty in market segmentation and customer targeting
- High operational costs for manual quality assessment
- Inconsistent quality standards across production batches

### 2.2 Research Questions

1. Can machine learning models accurately predict wine quality based on chemical properties?
2. Which machine learning algorithm performs best for wine quality classification?
3. What are the most important chemical features for quality prediction?
4. How can these models be implemented in business operations?

## 3. Dataset Description and Analysis

### 3.1 Dataset Characteristics

The Wine Quality dataset contains 1,599 red wine samples with 11 chemical properties and one quality rating. The dataset meets the assignment requirements with 11 input variables and over 1,000 instances. Key characteristics include:

- **Size:** 1,599 instances Ã— 12 attributes
- **Features:** 11 chemical properties (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol)
- **Target:** Quality rating (3-8 scale)
- **Data Quality:** No missing values, 240 duplicate entries
- **Data Types:** 11 float64 features, 1 int64 target variable

### 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis

Statistical analysis revealed significant insights about the dataset. The quality distribution shows a normal distribution centered around quality score 5-6, with 681 wines rated as 5 and 638 rated as 6. Correlation analysis identified strong relationships between alcohol content, sulphates, and volatile acidity with wine quality.

The dataset exhibits good data quality with no missing values, though 240 duplicate entries were identified. Feature analysis showed that alcohol content (mean: 10.42%) and volatile acidity (mean: 0.53) are key indicators of wine quality.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline included several critical steps:

1. **Quality Categorization:** Wines were classified into three categories:
   - Low Quality (scores 3-5): 744 wines
   - Medium Quality (score 6): 638 wines  
   - High Quality (scores 7-8): 217 wines

2. **Feature Engineering:** All 11 chemical properties were retained as they showed significant correlation with quality

3. **Data Splitting:** 80-20 train-test split with stratification to maintain class distribution

4. **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler applied for algorithms requiring normalization

### 4.2 Model Selection and Implementation

Four machine learning algorithms were implemented to ensure comprehensive evaluation:

1. **Random Forest Classifier:** Ensemble method with 100 estimators
2. **Gradient Boosting Classifier:** Boosting algorithm for improved performance
3. **Logistic Regression:** Linear model with regularization
4. **Support Vector Machine:** Non-linear classification with RBF kernel

### 4.3 Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using multiple metrics:
- Accuracy: Overall correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
